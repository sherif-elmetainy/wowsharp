# wowsharp
WOWSharp is a .NET Library for accessing Blizzard's World of Warcraft, Starcraft II and Diablo Community APIs on Battle.net. 
The Library is written in C# and is available for .NET Framework 4.5 and ASP.NET 5. 

This is a rewrite of original WOWSharp project at https://wowsharp.codeplex.com but the project at CodePlex is no longer being maintained.
This rewrite is still a work in progress and a lot of stuff is missing. 
Also since the rewrite relies in many aspects on beta versions of ASP.NET 5, a lot of stuff can break between beta releases.
